This application has only been tested with Google Chrome, and works
best with all of the available hardware acceleration options enabled:

+ GPU compositing on all pages: Enabled
+ Threaded compositing: Enabled
+ GPU Accelerated SVG Filters: Enable (not in use yet)

You can change these by visiting "chrome://flags" in Chrome. You'll need to
restart your browser to see a change.

These options keep the frame rate > 50fps on my Mac Mini, and appear
to prevent the Google Chrome Renderer process from exceeding 100% CPU
(staying on one core and using 7 threads).
